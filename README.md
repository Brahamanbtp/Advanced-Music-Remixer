## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a robust foundation for building modern web applications with React.

## Features

- **Multi-Track Support**: Add and manage multiple audio tracks.
- **Real-Time Effects**: Apply and customize effects like reverb, delay, distortion, and chorus.
- **Automation**: Automate parameter changes over time.
- **Visualization**: Visualize audio data with waveforms and spectrograms.
- **Collaboration**: Real-time collaboration features for multi-user environments.
- **Export**: Export your remixes to share with others.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-music-remixer.git
   cd advanced-music-remixer
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Start the Development Server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app in development mode. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

### Run Tests:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

## Testing

The project uses `@testing-library/react` and `jest-dom` for testing React components. The tests are located in the `src` directory alongside the components they test.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for better caching. Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

The `build` folder is ready to be deployed. See the section about deployment for more information.

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, such as customizing the build process or integrating with other tools, see the Advanced Configuration section.
